# The Movie Industry in the last decades 

The movie industry has changed a lot since the 80s. Back then, Hollywood focused on the internal market, and the cinema landscape was dominated by medium budget movies (>5 and <65 current million dollars). Today big studios are almost monopolies and own the most famous franchises. Movies now have big budgets, and lots of VFX and they have become huge events.

What happened? In this project I want to analyze the economic incentives that drove this change.
